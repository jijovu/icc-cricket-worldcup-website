        <p>The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup is the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day
            International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International
            Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament is being hosted by India. It started on 5 October and is scheduled to
            conclude on 19 November 2023. England were the defending champions, having won the 2019 edition by defeating
            New
            Zealand in the final.

            Ten national teams are participating. All had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World
            Cup
            qualification process. India qualified as hosts; Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand,
            Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri
            Lanka securing the final two places via the qualifier tournament in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023. The
            West
            Indies missed out on qualification for the first time in their history.

            It is the first men's Cricket World Cup which India is hosting solely. They co-hosted the 1987, 1996 and
            2011
            editions with other nations. The tournament is taking place in ten different stadiums, in ten cities across
            India. The first and second semi-finals will be held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in
            Kolkata
            respectively, while the final will take place at Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad.

            The top seven placed teams in the tournament's final points table, along with Pakistan, who are hosts, will
            qualify for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, the next ICC ODI tournament.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Originally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023. In July 2020 it was
            announced that that the tournament would be moved to October and November as a result of the qualification
            schedule being disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June
            2023.

            The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the competition after the Board of Control for
            Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan. This issue was
            resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the competition would be hosted using a
            hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.

            This is the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates will be given to bowling sides if
            they do
            not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires can penalise the bowling team by not
            allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.
        </p>
        <h2>Qualification</h2>
        <p>Like the previous World Cup, the tournament will feature 10 teams. The main route for qualification was,
            however,
            through the new ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, a series of matches played between 2020 and 2023 rather
            than
            the ODI rankings.The top eight of the 13 sides in the Super League qualified for the World Cup
            automatically, although as hosts India, who finished fourth, were guaranteed a place. In June and July 2023,
            the
            bottom five teams from the Super League and the top five ranked associate sides competed in the 2023 Cricket
            World Cup Qualifier for the remaining two places.

            As a result of the qualifying process, the competition is the first not to include former winners West
            Indies,
            who failed to progress from the qualifying process after their defeat to Scotland. Full members Ireland and
            Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the
            knock-out
            qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing. The final qualification spot fell to
            an eliminator between associate members, Scotland and Netherlands. The Netherlands won the eliminator and
            took the final spot in the finals stage of the competition.
        </p>
        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <p>The International Cricket Council announced the winner's trophy would tour the world 100 days before the
            commencement of the event. Photographs of the trophy were taken at each location.

            Ahead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the
            Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue. The organisers
            cancelled the opening ceremony, and replaced it with a press conference featuring the ten team captains.

            The ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup on August 19; following the announcement, there
            was
            an event held in Gurgaon with two U-19 World Cup-winning captains, Shafali Verma and Yash Dhull. The mascots
            are
            a male and female duo named "Tonk" and "Blaze" respectively from the fictional cricketing utopia called
            "Crictoverse". They embody the principle of gender equality.

            The official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled "Dil Jashn Bole" (transl. Heart say celebrate)
            was
            released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam while lyrics were written by Shloke Lal and
            Saaveri
            Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh
            and
            S. P. Charan. The accompanying music video featured actor Ranveer Singh, many Indian Instagram reel makers
            and
            YouTubers. However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.
        </p>
        <h2>Venues</h2>
        <p>The tournament is taking place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The
            first and second semi-finals will be held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata
            respectively, while the final will take place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

            The BCCI has provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket
            Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede
            Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. Chidambaram Stadium
            installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.

            With the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of
            moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they do not give the team batting second an
            advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men's T20 World Cup). These include using a specific
            wetting
            agent, and the boundary set at around 70 m (77 yards) at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to
            encourage
            seam bowling over spin bowling.
